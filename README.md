AI-Powered PDF Processing Pipeline
  1. Django Setup
    -Set up a Django backend to handle PDF uploads, text extraction, embedding, and querying.
    -Install required dependencies (Django, PyMuPDF, Tesseract, OpenAI API, etc.).
    -Implement necessary models for storing processed text and embeddings.

  2. Extract Text from Complex PDFs
  Challenge: Extracting text from PDFs containing images, tables, or non-standard layouts requires specialized processing techniques.


  Tools Used:
    PyMuPDF (fitz) – Extracts raw text and identifies embedded images/tables.
    Tesseract OCR – Performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images extracted from PDFs.
    Camelot / Tabula – Parses tabular data into structured formats like CSV or JSON.
  
  Extraction Pipeline:
  -Extract Raw Text & Identify Embedded Elements:
      Use PyMuPDF to extract textual content and detect embedded images or tables.  
  -OCR Processing for Image-Based PDFs:
      Pass detected images to Tesseract OCR for text recognition.
  -Table Extraction & Structuring: 
      using Camelot 
  -Data Aggregation:
    Merge extracted text, OCR-processed content, and structured tables into a unified text representation for further analysis.

  
3. Preprocess and Clean Extracted Text
  -Normalize text (remove special characters, redundant spaces, and artifacts).
  -Convert tabular data into a readable text format or structured JSON.
  -Handle multi-column layouts and reformat misaligned text.

4. Embed Text Using OpenAI API
  -Generate vector embeddings for extracted text using the OpenAI API.
  -Store embeddings in a vector database (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, or PostgreSQL + pgvector).


5. Implement PDF Upload & Query Interface
    Develop a simple HTML template for users to upload PDFs and ask questions.
    Ensure real-time processing and display of extracted content.

6. User Query Processing & Logical Matching
    Convert user questions into embeddings using OpenAI API.
    Chunking Strategy: Split extracted text into logical chunks (based on sentence boundaries or semantic similarity).
    Perform vector similarity search to match the user query with the most relevant PDF sections.

7. Return Answers Based on PDF Content
    If the answer is found in the PDF, return the extracted response.
    If no relevant answer is found, use OpenAI API to generate a response based on contextual understanding. (We are are working on the ai generating answer from API if informations are not provided on 

Next Improvements:
    Optimization for Speed:
        Implement batch processing for embedding generation.
        Optimize chunking techniques for better semantic search efficiency.
        Explore faster OCR models or lightweight embeddings for real-time query resolution.
